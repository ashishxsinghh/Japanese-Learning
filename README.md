# Japanese-Learning
Our goal is to reach Japanese fluency as directly as possible. Unlike a teacher or a textbook, we have the freedom to be ruthless in the path we take to get there.

**ZERO KNOWLEDGE OF JAPANESE**
Welcome to learning Japanese! This section is for the true beginner. You know little-to-no Japanese. Maybe a "konnichiwa" here and a "baka" there. These first steps you take are especially important because they're going to set a foundation you can build off of.

The more deliberate your steps, the easier everything that follows will be.

Carefully completing this section is going to be necessary if you want to avoid the thing that takes down most learners: the intermediate wall. Instead, take your time on these foundational steps. What feels slow now is actually speed later on.

Estimated Time: 1 day to 1 week(REMEMBER: YOU'RE NOT IN A CLASS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE AT THE SPEED OF THE SLOWEST 10%. THERE IS NO SPEED LIMIT.)
